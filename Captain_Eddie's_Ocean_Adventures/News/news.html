          <p class="narrative">
            BOCA RATON, FL- Captain Eddie led some fellow divers out to some of his favorite wreck dives. The favorite site on this adventure was the airplaine wreck. Located approximately one mile offshore, sitting in 82 feet of water in between the fingers of Boca reef, this simple engine Cessna 210 measuring about 25 feet crashed around 1978 after been chased by police for drug smuggle. With the impact the engine broke apart and now it sits 600 feet away from the airplane wreckage. The wreck is sitting upside down with the wings touching the sand. It is a small wreck, but excellent dive with schools of Atlantic spadefish circling the wreck!
